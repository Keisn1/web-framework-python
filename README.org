* Part 1
** WSGI
*** What is WSGI
WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) is a proposed standard as of PEP333 of how a Web Server should talk to a python web appilcation.

This gives way for a unified way of talking to python web applications for web servers, which in turn permits to deploy python web applications in a standardized way.
*** Application side
On the application side, we have the application object, which shall be callable and take 2 positional arguments
#+begin_src python :results output
def simple_app(environ, start_response):
#+end_src
It shall return an iterable yielding zero or more strings
