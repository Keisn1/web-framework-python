A WSGI middleware component is a Python callable that is itself a WSGI application, but may handle requests by delegating to other WSGI applications.
These applications can themselves be WSGI middleware components.[7]

A middleware component can perform such functions as:[7]
- Routing a request to different application objects based on the target URL, after changing the environment variables accordingly.
- Allowing multiple applications or frameworks to run side-by-side in the same process
- Load balancing and remote processing, by forwarding requests and responses over a network
- Performing content post-processing, such as applying XSLT stylesheets

Components that play both sides
- usually used for tweaking the request

middleware talks to both components
- therefore needs to adhere to the specification of the [[id:637c51ef-cc7d-4cf0-bda2-9dc625b60dc7][Application object]] as well as the [[id:fe288fc1-457d-46be-aa41-5ae2235d35ed][Server side specification]]
